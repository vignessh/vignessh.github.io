Hello, I'm Vignessh, and I can talk to both people and
computers.

Iâ€™m a developer at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/).
I spend most of my time helping teams make the right kind of technology and architecture choices,
and the rest of my time talking to customers and users about what we should be building.
I love programming and I code mostly in [Clojure](https://clojure.org) and [GoLang](https://golang.org).
I write most of my code in [Emacs](https://emacsredux.com/)

I've been involved in building bespoke solutions for a while. You can find out about
that on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vignesshv).

You can find me on other social networks too, like [twitter](https://twitter.com/vignesshv), and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vignesshv/).
I have a bit of photography bug in me as well, here is my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/vignessh) photostream.

In my spare time you will find me teaching at IndiMotard [T.W.O](https://indimotard.com/two/) school. We frequent
the [MMRT](https://en.madrasmotorsports.com/club/our-circuit/) race track at Chennai and the [Kari Motor Speedway](http://www.lgsports.co.in/) at Coimbatore.

I started riding on the track initially on a *2004 [Yamaha RXZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_RX-Z)* 5 speed. It was a peppy little two-stroke with a good usable torque and decent brakes. After a few years, the upgrade bug hit me and I got myself a *2006 [Honda CBR 600RR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_CBR600RR)*. It was a fabulous machine and taught me a lot of things about riding well. I recently sold it to a good friend and got myself my dream bike of all time - the *2018 [Aprilia RSV4 RF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aprilia_RSV4)*.
