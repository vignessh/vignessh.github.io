Hello, I'm Vignessh. I'm a developer working for ThoughtWorks. I'm interested in programming languages, programming paradigms and distributed systems. I'm also an avid track day rider. I frequent the [MMRT][mmrt] track at Chennai or the [Kari speed way][kari-speed-way] at Coimbatore.

I started riding on the track initially on a *2004 [Yamaha RXZ][yamaha-rxz]* 5 speed. It was a peppy little two-stroke with a good usable torque and decent brakes. After a few years, the upgrade bug hit me and I got myself a *2006 [Honda CBR 600RR][cbr-600rr]*. It was a fabulous machine and taught me a lot of things about riding well. I recently sold it to a good friend and got myself my dream bike of all time - the *2018 [Aprilia RSV4 RF][aprilia-rsv4]*.
