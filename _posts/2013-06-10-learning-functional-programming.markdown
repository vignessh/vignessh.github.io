Have been trying to work out the samples from the book [**Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications**](http://www.amazon.in/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Segaran/dp/8184043708) in Clojure. I have been having a hard time expressing code in a functional style without having to resort to imperative style using doseq and the likes. I also discovered some really good blog posts on using the various Clojure API correctly to achieve what we want.
