For somebody who is getting into the IT sector today, there is a huge learning curve when it comes to the sheer number of programming languages, tools, libraries, paradigms and more. Most often times, we tend to do a Google search or maybe a Stackoverflow search to clarify our doubts or even to get started. Learning on the job is okay, but it becomes detrimental to one's growth after a certain point of time.

We tend to hurry and constantly tell ourselves to put important decisions in the backlog like figuring out why something behaves in a certain way. Over a period of time, this backlog grows and when left unattended, tends to overbear us with its sheer size.
